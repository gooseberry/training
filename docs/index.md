The site is designed to present all the necessary information to follow an advanced training plan, complete with strength conditioning, cardio workouts, and a variety of yoga flows targetting both balance and stretches.  The goal of these training plans is to provide a complete full body, well rounded set of workouts to maximize your results and get you in the best shape of your life.

## Workouts

A collection of individual exercises grouped together to achieve a specific goal.  For example, strength conditioning workouts will typically include a series of exercises designed to target a specific muscle group.
