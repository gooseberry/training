## 30-20-10 Workout

### Description

The 30-20-10 Workout routine is a variety on the High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) consisting of 8 different rounds (or sets) of three exercises.  Each of the three exercises within a set should be completed for 30 seconds, 20 seconds, or 10 seconds respectively and the set should be completed a total of 4 times without a pause.  Take a full minute break before continuing on to the next round and continue on so until all 8 rounds are completed.

#### Example

The table below outlines a basic 30-20-10 round with three different exercises.  Note the number next to each exercise which denotes the amount of time dedicated to each.

    ##### Round 1: Cardio - 4 sets

    | Exercise | Duration |
    |---       |---       |
    | Mountain Climbers |  30 secs |
    | High Knees        |  20 secs |
    | Shuffle           |  10 secs |

In this example, your first round starts with 30 seconds of Mountain Climbers, followed immediately with 20 seconds of High Knees, and finally 10 seconds of Shuffle.  Once you complete the 10 seconds of Shuffle, you should immediately return to the Mountain Climbers for another 30 seconds and continue in this order until you have completed each exercise 4 times.  Once you've completed this, take a full minute break, grab some water and catch your breath before jumping into the next round.

    ##### Round 2: Legs - 4 sets

    | Exercise | Duration |
    |---       |---       |
    | Jump Lunges |  30 secs |
    | Jump Squats        |  20 secs |
    | Squat Hold           |  10 secs |

The second round runs exactly like the first.  Complete 30 seconds of Jump Lunges, transitioning to 20 seconds of Jump Squats before coming down into a low squat position for 10 seconds.  This one is hard one and your legs will be burning at the end of the 4 minute round.

    It's important to take a pause if your feeling exhausted.  When you can't keep a good form for the movements or you are struggling to keep up, stop.  Take a breath to recover and continue on once you're ready.
