# Workouts

Several workouts are listed in this section.  These are sets of exercises combined together according to a specific goal.  Some workouts will target a specific muscle group while others will be aimed at providing a good cardio workout or some sort of recovery.  The exercises within the workout are all linked to their respective page so that you can quickly find out additional information about that particular exercise without searching too much.

    The values for repetitions and weigth listed within the workouts are general recommendations and might not be suited for your abilities.  Use judgement when selecting weights to fit your goals and be mindful of your limitations.  When in doubt, err on the side of caution - grab a smaller weight or take a break in the middle of a set when needed.
