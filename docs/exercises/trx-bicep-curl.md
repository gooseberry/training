From a split stance position, facing toward the TRX anchor point, hold your upper arms straight out in front of you, wrists pointing up.  Keep your upper arm from moving and bend your elbow up toward your face to lift your body up, maintaining a straight body position throughout the movement.  Once you have bent your elbows past the 90-degree mark, slowly straighten your elbows to lower your body and return to the starting position.
