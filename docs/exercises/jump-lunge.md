#  Jump Lunge

!!! equipment "No equipment required for this exercise."

## Instructions

1. Stand in a lunge position with on leg forward, knee bent to 90 degrees and your thigh parallel to the floor.  Your other knee should be in line with your back to form a straight line down as close to the floor as you can.
2. Jump off the floor with both feet and switch your leg position mid-air to land in a lunge with the opposite leg forward.
3. Repeat this movement for the duration of the exercise.

## Variations

!!! strength "Variation for strength"

    Take your time between each jump to go deep into the lunge and drive your knee low.  You will need to slow down the pace to accomplish this, but this will engage your quads and glutes making this a very effective leg burner.

!!! cardio "Variation for cardio"

    Sacrifice some depth in your lunge to increase the speed of the switches, jumping more often but staying higher in the lunge.  The faster movement will increase your heart rate during a cardio workout.

!!! yoga "Variation for low impact"

    As a low-impact alternative, you can perform alternating reverse lunges.  The reverse lunge doesn't provide as intense of a cardio workout and can also be used as an active recovery if you are too exhausted.
