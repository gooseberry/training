#  Jump Squat

!!! equipment "No equipment required for this exercise."

--8<-- "squat.md"

## Instructions

1. Power up through your legs to jump up into the air, swinging your arms back for extra momentum.  Land softly bending your knees back to the high squat position.

## Variations

!!! strength "Variation for strength"

    Take your time between each jump to go deep into the squat and drive your hips down.  You will need to slow down the pace to accomplish this, but this will engage your quads and glutes making this a very effective leg burner.

!!! cardio "Variation for cardio"

    Sacrifice some depth in your squat to increase the speed of the jumps.  The faster movement will increase your heart rate during a cardio workout.

!!! yoga "Variation for low impact"

    Avoid jumping if you have sore knees or if you are getting too tired.  In this variation, you still power up to standing, but instead of jumping off the floor, use the momentum to lift your heels high up and keep the balls of your feet firmly planted.
