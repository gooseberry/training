The 30-20-10 Workout routine is a variation on High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) consisting of 8 different rounds (or sets) of three exercises.  Each of the three exercises within a set should be completed for 30 seconds, 20 seconds, and 10 seconds respectively.  The set should be completed a total of 4 times without a pause.  Once you've completed a round, take a full minute break before continuing on to the next round and continue on so until all 8 rounds are completed.
