    * Walk your feet out further from the anchor point and stand further up to decrease the resistance and make this more easier.
    * Walk your feet in closer to the anchor point and lean further down to increase the resistance and make this move more challenging.
    * If your feet are directly below the anchor point, adjust the TRX strap longer to lean lower and further increase the challenge.
