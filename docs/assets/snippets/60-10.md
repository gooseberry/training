The 60-10 Workout routine is a variation on High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) consisting of 6 rounds of 6 exercises.  In each round, you will start with the first exercise and complete it for 60 seconds, the second exercise for 50 seconds, and continue to reduce the duration each successive exercise by 10 seconds until you complete the last exercise for 10 seconds.  Give yourself 5 to 10 seconds between exercises to transition.  Once the round is complete, take a full minute break before continuing on to the next round.  

For the second round, shift all the exercises by one, start with the last exercise and to that for 60 seconds.  The first exercise from the first round becomes the second exercise in this round.  The second exercise becomes the third, and so on.  Shift the exercises at every round so that at the end of the 6th and final round, you will have completed each exercise in this workout at each interval.
