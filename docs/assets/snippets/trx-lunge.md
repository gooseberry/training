## Starting Position

TRX Lunge

:   Adjust the straps in single handle use and set length so the handles are at knee height.  Turn away from the anchor point and insert the top of one foot into the TRX foot hold.  The top of the foot should rest inside the foot loop, don't pull it up to your ankle.  Once your foot is well rested in the foot hold, hop away from the anchor point on your opposite foot until you are in a lunge position.
