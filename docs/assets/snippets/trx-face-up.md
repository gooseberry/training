## Starting Position

TRX Face Up

:   Adjust the straps so the handles are at waist height.  Stand with your legs shoulder width apart, grab one handle of the TRX straps in each hand and lean back away from the TRX anchor point with your arms straight out in front of you.  Walk your feet in while leaning back on your heels the entire time until your body is diagonal with your chest facing the sky.
