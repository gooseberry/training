!!! equipment "Set your TRX handles for single handle use."

    1. Grab both handles and hold them one on to the top of the other.
    2. Take the handle on the bottom and pass through the top handles webbing (upper part of the handle).  Now the handle that was on the bottom is on top.
    3. Repeat this process so that the bottom handle again goes through the top.
    4. Pull the top handle to tighten up, if this has been corrected it will be safe to work in single-handed mode.
